# MoMo Data Analysis App

## About

This is my project for the MoMo Data Analysis assignment. Itâ€™s a full-stack app that processes SMS data from MTN MoMo, a mobile payment service in Rwanda. The app reads an XML file with about 1600 SMS messages, cleans and organizes the data, stores it in a SQLite database, and shows it on a dashboard with charts and filters.

## Goals

- Read and process SMS data from an XML file.
- Clean the data and sort it into categories like payments, transfers, and withdrawals.
- Save the data in a SQLite database for easy access.
- Build a dashboard with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show data insights.

## Tools Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLite, xml.etree.ElementTree (for XML parsing)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js (for charts)
- **Other**: Git for version control
